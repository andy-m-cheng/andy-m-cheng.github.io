      <h2 class="h2">Overview</h2>
      <div class="text-content-wrap">
        <p class="text-content">Spotify has changed the way music is consumed by millions of people worldwide. The audio streaming service is built on providing simplified access to a vast library of artists and songs, with its primary vehicle being mobile devices; as of 2018, GlobalWebIndex has reported an average 60% mobile usage vs 42% on desktop. The core appeal and value of Spotify has remained the same: efficiently accessing, organizing, and discovering music.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content-wrap">
        <p class="text-content">A June 2019 update to the Your Library portion of the mobile app nixed several key features, compromising this core appeal and value. In this redesign, I analyzed the changes and subsequent user responses, identified and reintegrated necessary components, and incorporated desktop-specific features onto the mobile platform.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Facing the Music</h2>
      <div class="text-content-wrap">
        <p class="text-content">The focus of this redesign was on the music portion of Spotify; despite the platforms recent expansion into podcasts, the platform&#x27;s cornerstone is its music service. From Q3 2019 reportings, only 14% of monthly active users listen to podcasts. The redesign does not take away from the podcast experience, rather improves upon and fixes issues with the flawed music system. Additionally, while I based my redesign and research on the Android application which I had most access to, additional platform research found no significant difference between the iOS and Android version and issues and solutions are universal across the two operating systems.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Initial Reactions</h2>
      <div class="text-content-wrap">
        <p class="text-content">When the update hit devices in June 2019, I enjoyed the refreshed interface of “Your Library”; its new look and feel was sleek and modern. However, moving past the shiny, new paint-job revealed gutted functionality. A brief search about the update shows thousands of complaints from users, angrily demanding their old Spotify back. Many users, including myself, were forced to change the way we used the application and lost our personalized libraries.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Research and immersion</h2>
      <div class="text-content-wrap">
        <p class="text-content">To familiarize myself with the pre-update Spotify, I rolled back the application on my device and spent a few days using the platform. I compared my experience between versions to identified what had been changed, and how it impacted my experience and use. I also combed through users responses and complaints from various channels, including Spotify’s own support forum. Often times the loudest voices are not always representative of the majority; therefore, to gain a more holistic perspective, I spoke with various Spotify users not only about the the update, but how they use Spotify everyday. A consistent theme stood out from the forum posts and user interviews:</p>

        <h3 class="h3 content white">Saving songs</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content-wrap">
        <p class="text-content">A distinct and nuanced annoyance I had about the update was the change from &quot;adding&quot; to &quot;liking&quot; songs. All liked songs are now complied in a playlist, but songs added to other playlist are not automatically liked, meaning they are not saved in a stable and permanent fashion, facilitating the potential “loss” of songs if a playlist is deleted.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content-wrap">
        <p class="text-content">The redesign reintroduced the Songs section to Your Library, containing all songs users have saved, whether from adding to a playlist or manually saving. The “liking” system and the “Liked Songs” playlist was kept to both nudge users to create their own playlist, and as another point of reference for Spotify&#x27;s recommendation algorithm,</p>

        <p class="text-content">Spotify has commented that following certain artists better tailors recommendations, and notifications of artists’ activities.

        <p class="text-content">With over 4 billion playlists on the streaming service and many users creating 10+ playlists, it is imperative to provide efficient organization. On the desktop application, users are able to arrange their playlists in a custom order. This custom order is viewable but uneditable on mobile applications. This desktop exclusivity makes little sense to mobile-centric platform.</p>

      <div class="text-content-wrap">
        <p class="text-content">The redesign introduces a simple method for mobile rearrangement.

        <p class="text-content">Like the custom ordering of playlists, listening history is only available on desktop. This oversight would be not as egregious if history between devices was synced, but it&#x27;s not; the history on the desktop platform is desktop specific, and does not reflect activity from the mobile application.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content-wrap">
        <p class="text-content">This lack of synchronization could be remedied in the backend, but a better solution would be to also include listening history on the mobile platform.

      <div class="text-content-wrap">
        <p class="text-content">Spotify has undoubtedly changed the way a generation consumes music. However, in recent pursuits of prettier interfaces, the company has negatively impacted the core experience and value offered by the audio platform. The June 2019 update restricted users and stripped away many vital, organizational features. In this redesign, I hope to recapture the functionality and freedom of the past and crucial desktop features into the mobile application, while packaging it all in the same, sleek look and feel of the new Spotify.</p>

            <p class="text-content">While working on this project, I focused on maintaining the look and feel of an existing product. I wanted the redesign to still feel like Spotify, and took meticulous care work within the company&#x27;s existing design system. New features like the drag bars for the custom playlist and the listening history were designed to be consistent with previous implementations of similar Spotify features.</p>

            <p class="text-content">Given more time and access to users, I would love to test the redesign with actual users and see if the resigned application both solves the identified issues, and does not introduce new problems. With Spotify&#x27;s new interest in podcasts, I would also like to examine that side of the platform. As for other features, I believe that the scrolling system needs to be reworked as navigating through extensive libraries is time consuming without some form of quick alphabetical scrolling.</p>
